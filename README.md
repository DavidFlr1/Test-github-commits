# Welcome to github-commits-history project
  The goal of this project will be to create a web application that shows git commit history for the project youâ€™re working on.

  Instructions
    You must use the GitHub API - while you could make a scraper or devise another method to get the git commit history of your project, we would like to see how you work with an existing API. 

    Your GitHub repository must be public - this will allow us to look at it and verify the accuracy of your code. Once you complete this project, you will need to send over the link to your project to us with the email address provided below.

    The style of the page is up to you. Typically we use something like Bootstrap (http://getbootstrap.com) for a lot of our projects, then style it to meet the business want or need later on. 

    The app should have at least 3 routes. One route for the repo/commits, one route should contain profile information, and the final route can contain any additional information that you find could be useful from the API.

    You MUST provide instructions in the README on how to install and run your project. We will not infer anything, and if you do not include these instructions, we will reject your submission.+

  2. Run 'npm start'
